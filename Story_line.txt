Spawn in Amy's room

Don't say that this person has a multi-personality disorder. 

AMY:
	Like cooking, favorite dish is Mac&Cheese

	Fan of Greek Mythology

	How she felt about Eddie.
		Portrey Eddie as this bad bad guy.
		Reveal that Eddie is terrible, and he tries to eliminate me
			Eddie is dominating. I feel that he is trying to eliminate me
		But she is still sympathetic toward Edie. 
			I hope Eddie can live rather than me. Maybe he just want to live
			But I don't want to just disappear. I hope Eddie can remember me, I hope when my friends come and find me, Eddie could at least tell them what had 				happen to me. 
			David had also agreed that we don't show this to Eddie early on. He need to figure out this by himself. 
			
		I can sense that my existence is really feeble. I guess this will be the last thing I will write on this diary, or any thing. Ha. 
		I love Mac & Cheese
		I love Greek Mythology -- That's why I named him Eddie. 
		I love David. I want to see him again. 
		Eddie, carry my hope and live.
